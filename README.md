# Section V: Objections to the Greater Male Variability Hypothesis

No one disputes that greater male variability is present in some populations. But some authors have asserted that it is not present everywhere, and drawn the implication that the phenomenon is merely a result of cultural influence. In some cases, they correctly find that not every cognitive measure consistently exhibits GMV. But I will argue that these publications repeatedly make three types of errors: (1) overconfidence in inferences from small and/or low-quality samples that appear to present exceptions to GMV; (2) failures to consider how both mean and variability differences affect TPRs; and (3) failures to recognize that, while environmental influences and random variation are expected to cause fluctuation in VRs across populations, sex differences in variability are not utterly compliant to culture. There is a clear tendency toward GMV and, importantly, there is no solid evidence for even a single population that does not exhibit GMV in a large majority of cognitive abilities. I will review each of the various empirical challenges to GMV.

__Hyde, Lindberg, Linn, Ellis, and Williams (2008)__ reported sex differences in math assessments given in compliance with the No Child Left Behind Act. About 7.2 million scores were used from students in grades 2 to 11 in ten US states. In all grades, the mean sex differences were no larger than _d_ = 0.06 in magnitude while male variances were 11-21% greater. The authors offered one subset among many — Asian-American 11th-grade students in Minnesota — in order to show that male overrepresentation in the upper tail was not universal. Among these students, the TPR above the total group’s 95th percentile was 1.09, but above the 99th percentile it was 0.91, indicating that a larger proportion of females scored above this cut-point. This was subsequently highlighted — by three major review papers and others — as a point of significance, ostensibly illustrating the malleability of sex disparities in the right tail (Bosson et al., 2018, p. 237; Ceci et al., 2009, 2014; Fine, 2010; Fine et al., 2019; Hyde & Mertz, 2009; Mozahem et al., 2018; Priess & Hyde, 2010; Y. Zhou et al., 2017). However, none of them noted the size of the subsample on which their assertions were based. The article did not explicitly disclose this figure, but it can be calculated that the tail in question almost certainly contained 25 females and 23 males (see [Appendix A](https://github.com/SexVar/Section-V/blob/main/Appendix%20A.numbers)). In light of the simulation studies conducted above, one cannot justify any meaningful conclusion by comparing a couple dozen members of each sex. Such tenuous evidence does not warrant sweeping claims, as were made by researchers who cited this TPR. Subsamples as small as 48 (i.e., 25 + 23) yield highly unreliable TPRs. Table S4 shows that when the real TPR in the top 1% is 1.10, about 37% of tails containing 50 data points produce TPRs below 1 (compared to a random 50%). With a higher real TPR of 1.20, the directional error rate is still about 26%. The results are quite similar regardless of the underlying combination of mean and variance differences.

Minnesota provided scores from six other grades of similar size, but the authors selectively reported TPRs only from grade 11. So given seven grades in which a TPR less than 1 could be singled out, it is highly likely that at least one would appear even if random sampling error were the only cause. Hyde et al. did not justify their selective publication of TPRs from only one of seven grades in Minnesota. Further, the authors did not examine how mean and variance differences interacted to produce the TPRs. A higher proportion of females could be expected in the right tail even if male variance were larger, given a superior female mean in the subsample. This important conceptual problem was elided by the authors and many of the researchers above who cited them: a higher proportion of females above a certain cut-point does not necessarily emerge from greater female variability (in fact, it rarely does). So TPRs lower than 1 in isolation are not evidence against GMV. More succinctly, TPR < 1 does not imply VR < 1. To address the question directly rather than obliquely through TPRs, was there a race × sex × variance interaction in these assessments? Minnesota as well as two other states supplied data disaggregated by race, and males were 5-25% more variable in all racial groups in all three states. So the study does not provide convincing, generalizable evidence for racial differences in VRs or TPRs. The [main results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SexVar/Section-V/main/Hyde%20VRs.png) are strong support for GMV in math scores in the US: broken down by state and grade, male scores were more variable in 65 of 66 groups and VRs ranged from 0.94 to an exceptionally high 2.39.

__Hyde and Mertz (2009)__ reviewed evidence on sex differences in mathematical ability and performance, and chiefly marshaled three papers in their arguments against GMV (Guiso et al., 2008; Hyde et al., 2008; Penner, 2008). Unlike the others, whose claims have been or will be addressed on their own, Guiso, Monte, Sapienza, and Zingales (2008) did not themselves contest GMV in their analysis of 2003 PISA scores from 40 countries. So Hyde and Mertz’s appeal to their findings will be examined here. There are serious problems with their case against GMV. Most strikingly, they twice conflated the concepts represented by TPR < 1 and VR < 1 (as emphasized in the paragraph above). First they cited the TPR found by Hyde et al. (2008) among Asian-American 11th-graders in Minnesota without divulging the tiny sample size underlying it. They followed by identifying a few countries in the 2003 PISA with math tail ratios below 1 beyond the 95th percentile. (Guiso et al. computed tail ratios rather than tail proportion ratios, which are similar in PISA data.) Hyde and Mertz then stated, “These findings challenge the Greater Male Variability Hypothesis, which, if valid, should hold for all representative populations, regardless of ethnicity or nationality” (p. 8803). But neither of the results they described could have adjudicated upon sex differences in variability, because they applied to tails alone.

The second conflation occurred when they computed two correlations, both of which indicated a greater proportion of females in the right tail of math performance in countries with higher gender equality. They used 2003 PISA math scores to calculate a negative country-level correlation between the Global Gender Gap Index and 95th percentile tail ratios. They also found a positive correlation between the gender equality index and female participation in the International Mathematical Olympiad. They then claimed that these correlations stood “in distinct contrast” (p. 8806) to Machin and Pekkarinen’s (2008) lack of correlation between gender equality and VRs in the 2003 PISA — the same data Hyde and Mertz used. These are compatible results, and they seem to clash only if one does not draw the appropriate distinction between VRs and TPRs. The correlations likely coincided because more gender-equal countries had higher female means (relative to male means), so females tended to be more represented in the right tail of more gender-equal countries even with no systematic shift in VRs. For these reasons, none of the ways in which Hyde and Mertz invoked Guiso et al.’s findings were capable of directly probing sex differences in variability. In fact, Guiso et al. did not conduct any analyses on variability differences — only on mean differences and ratios in the top 5% and 1%. If one aims to connect TPRs to VRs, one must factor in differences at the center.

Hyde and Mertz (2009) were not the only authors to overlook the distinction between VR < 1 and TPR < 1. It is worth observing how often this occurs. In their textbook on psychology and gender, Bosson et al. (2018) stated that GMV “does not hold consistently for people in every racial and ethnic group. For example, Hyde et al. (2008) found greater male than female variability in math performance for White students, but not for Asian students” (p. 237). Although Hyde et al. (2008) demonstrated TPR < 1, Bosson et al. inferred VR < 1. And in a review of academic gender differences, Priess and Hyde (2010) wrote:

<sup>“Also important, however, is that the variance ratio appears to vary by ethnicity. For instance, in analyses of selective high school students from one U.S. state, the authors noted that VR = 2.06 for White, but only 0.91 for Asian American, 11th graders who scored in the top one percent on their state assessment. That is, among Whites, more boys than girls scored at the top of the distribution, whereas among Asian Americans, more girls than boys scored in the top one percent. … These findings shed some doubts on the notion that boys and men always exhibit more variance in ability than do girls and women” (p. 304).</sup>

Variance ratios did not vary by ethnicity: when Priess and Hyde cited VRs of 2.06 and 0.91, they were referring to TPRs. They began to reverse course by providing a definition of TPRs, but proceeded with a conclusion that could logically follow only if the numbers had been VRs. The conflation of VR and TPR was so complete here that it led to a misstatement of plain facts. These instances do not exhaust the confusion around these concepts.

[Discussion of flaws in TIMSS analyses by __Kane and Mertz (2012)__ and __Penner (2008)__]

__Zuze and Reddy (2016)__ analyzed math assessments from the 2007 Southern and Eastern African Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ). VRs indicated GMV in 14 of the 15 African countries tested, ranging from 0.91 to 1.31 with a median of 1.14. Despite the high consistency of GMV, the authors wrote, “If variability was consistently greater among boys compared to girls, then the variance ratios for the 15 sub-Saharan African education systems would be greater than 1 and more or less the same in magnitude” (p. 15). Others have made similar stipulations. Spelke (2005) wrote in a highly cited review: “If the genetic contribution were strong, however, then males should predominate at the upper tail of performance in all countries and at all times, and the male–female ratio should be of comparable size across different samples” (p. 956). This conception of the greater male variability hypothesis contravenes what some have called the “interactionist consensus”: the recognition that all traits are caused both genetically and environmentally, and that to assert the supremacy of either category would be incoherent (Sterelny & Griffiths, 1999, p. 97). Zuze and Reddy characterized GMV as an impossibly rigid prediction, which would anticipate VRs within a small interval — how small was not specified, nor why this would be important. Such a restriction is not needed for any viable form of the GMV hypothesis. It overlooks the variation one should expect from systematic differences across populations, such as differences in curricula and resources — creating differences in the constructs measured by the same items — as well as from random sampling error (see section I). Zuze and Reddy selected Tanzania to exhibit another putative deviation from the predictions of GMV. They noted that males were overrepresented in the right tail (TPR > 1) but not the left (TPR ≈ 1), despite a VR of 1.31. But this is easily reconciled by observing that Tanzania had the largest mean gap in favor of males of all 15 countries, shifting the male distribution to the right of the female distribution. Given this, parity in the left tail is evidence in _favor_ of GMV; without it, one would expect a left TPR far below 1. As before, TPRs illuminate differences in variance only when differences in central tendency are accounted for as well.

Excluding the present article, the monograph by __McNemar and Terman (1936; hereafter M&T)__ contains the most publications of any review devoted to this question. So despite its age it is important to scrutinize the authors’ conclusion — that GMV is consistently evident in “standardized verbal intelligence test batteries” (p. 56), but otherwise there is no pattern to be found. They surveyed many nonrandom samples (e.g., Kaulfers, 1928) alongside unselected samples without distinguishing between them. Here will be considered samples larger than 1,000, including only those which do not present obvious concerns of representativeness. Three student samples given a group test of intelligence were analyzed by The Staff of the Division of Psychology of the Institute of Educational Research, Teachers College, Columbia University (1926a, 1926b). Their average VRs were 1.14, 1.11, and 1.03 (data from M&T). Other verbal tests produced VRs of 1.51 (Pressey, 1918, data from M&T); 1.24 (Conrad, Jones, & Hsiao, 1933); 1.05 (Whitmire, 1920, data from M&T); 1.04 (Dickson, data from M&T); and 0.88 (Broom, 1930). Another standardized verbal test was given by Whipple (1927). Although he did not provide summary statistics, examining his 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles shows that males were more widely dispersed in both directions despite an inferior median score. The gap between the 90th and 10th percentiles was 95 points in males and 88 in females.

Using the distinction made by M&T, there were also several assessments with large sample sizes which were not standardized verbal tests. A departure from GMV appeared to present itself in data from Pintner (1924), in which both 10- and 12-year-olds in a sample of 2,270 showed greater female variability. This was, however, an error in M&T’s data extraction. Pintner’s paper shows that the standard deviations were reversed, and the average VR was 1.11. Woody (1931) did not provide standard deviations, but his arithmetic test produced a larger interquartile range in males among 1,107 six-year-olds. An approximation of the standard deviations using a method by Wan et al. (2014) gives an estimated variance ratio of 1.42. Snoddy and Hyde (1921) reported results from tests of over 15,000 students across Utah. They provided selective statistics on sex differences only from ten-year-olds (n=2,321), and on only two of their seven test batteries. They found much larger male variability on a task which asked students to enumerate blocks seen in pictures of stacked blocks (VR=1.38); and larger female variability on a task which asked students to indicate whether two numbers in paired columns were identical or not (VR=0.88). It is unclear whether these tests were chosen randomly or for the contrast they provided. Variability differences are unfortunately not known for the other test batteries, nor for the bulk of students who were in other age groups. Other tests found VRs of 1.00 (Trabue, 1916) and 0.80 (Carroll, 1933). How does McNemar and Terman’s judgment hold up once smaller samples are discarded? GMV was found in six of seven publications with data on standardized verbal assessments. Regardless of whether one values the data from Snoddy and Hyde (1921) very much, the non-standardized tests as an aggregate slightly favored GMV. The two publications among them which did not find GMV shared an overt feature. They were verbal tasks, with female superiority at the mean: completion of sentences with missing words (Trabue, 1916) and judgment of writing quality (Carroll, 1933). The somewhat differing results generated by standardized verbal tests and others can thus largely be understood by attending to the kinds of assessments that deviated from GMV. Before concluding, the authors referred to a detailed review of sex differences by Lincoln (1927), whose chapter on variability was muddled by including many small samples without recognizing their shortcomings. Most notably, Lincoln reported original analyses of an intelligence assessment of 3,422 students, from which I computed a VR of 1.02.

Decades later, __Feingold (1994)__ reviewed testing data from about 20 countries and concluded that GMV in cognitive abilities does not hold across cultures. Many authors have uncritically cited the paper in favor of his conclusion (e.g., Bielinski & Davison, 1998; Caplan & Caplan, 2009, p. 19; Ceci et al., 2009; De Lisle et al., 2005; Deary, Thorpe, et al., 2003; Fine, 2010; Flores-Mendoza et al., 2018; Knopik & DeFries, 1998; Lohman & Lakin, 2009; Mozahem et al., 2018; Penner, 2008; Petersen, 2013; Spelke, 2005; Strand et al., 2006; Valian, 1998, p. 138; Vista & Care, 2011). Critiques have been virtually absent, but the study has alarming weaknesses. Some of the samples he included were far too small to plausibly be representative of their national or regional populations, and some did not even attempt such a design. He did not acknowledge that tests of 186 Egyptian teenagers (Abdel-Rahim et al., 1990) or 74 rural Filipino children (Church et al., 1985) were inadequate to generalize to the respective population or overcome random sampling error. Despite his claims to the contrary, Feingold did not select samples meant to be generally representative. The Egyptian study, for instance, tested self-selected pairs of twins. It is possible to clarify the pattern of results by partitioning the data by sample size.

The data taken as a whole show a moderate tendency toward GMV but lawless variation across different populations, with many VRs below 1. Representative samples with 1,000-5,000 participants found greater male variability in math (VR=1.12) and Spanish (VR=1.05) in Costa Rica (Esquivel & Brenes, 1988); and math (VR=1.18) and reading (VR=1.25) in Peru (H. W. Stevenson et al., 1990). Two standardizations of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale produced VRs of 1.04 in Scotland and 0.98 in China for full scale IQ (Dai et al., 1991; Lynn & Mulhern, 1991). A math assessment gave a VR of 0.88 in Canada (Hanna, 1986), and Visser’s (1987) report of tests given to students in South Africa showed larger female variability on several tasks (VRs of 0.90-0.98). And among 13- and 17-year-olds in an international math assessment, VRs in 14 samples of the relevant sizes ranged from 0.94 to 1.28 (Harnisch et al., 1986; Steinkamp et al., 1985). The results are more orderly among samples larger than 5,000. On a variety of mathematical and spatial tasks in the US, Scotland, England, Hong Kong, Sweden, and the UK, males were 6-22% more variable (Cheung, 1989; Emanuelsson & Svensson, 1986; Harnisch et al., 1986; Lynn, 1992; Steinkamp et al., 1985). The exception was a verbal subtest in Sweden (average VR=0.94), which required participants to select a word’s correct antonym among four choices. Focusing on samples of higher quality thus clears away most of the apparent vacillation of VRs across populations, and the exception among the largest samples was again a verbal task.
