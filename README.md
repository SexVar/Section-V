# Section V: Objections to the Greater Male Variability Hypothesis

Hyde, Lindberg, Linn, Ellis, and Williams (2008) reported sex differences in math assessments given in compliance with the No Child Left Behind Act. About 7.2 million scores were used from students in grades 2 to 11 in ten US states. In all grades, the mean sex differences were no larger than _d_ = 0.06 in magnitude while male variances were 11-21% greater. The authors noted that male overrepresentation in the upper tail was not universal by exhibiting a particular subset: Asian-American 11th-grade students in Minnesota. Among these students, the TPR above the total group’s 95th percentile was 1.09, but above the 99th percentile it was 0.91, indicating that a larger proportion of females scored above this cut-point. This was subsequently highlighted — by three major review papers and others — as a point of significance, ostensibly illustrating the malleability of sex disparities in the right tail (Bosson et al., 2018, p. 237; Ceci et al., 2009, 2014; Fine, 2010; Fine et al., 2019; Hyde & Mertz, 2009; Mozahem et al., 2018; Priess & Hyde, 2010; Y. Zhou et al., 2017). However, none of them noted the size of the subsample on which their assertions were based. The article did not explicitly disclose this figure, but it can be calculated that the tail in question almost certainly contained 25 females and 23 males (see Appendix A). In light of the simulation studies conducted above, one cannot justify any meaningful conclusion by comparing a couple dozen members of each sex. Such tenuous evidence does not warrant sweeping claims, as were made by researchers who cited this TPR. Subsamples as small as 48 (i.e., 25 + 23) yield highly unreliable TPRs. Table S4 shows that when the real TPR in the top 1% is 1.10, about 37% of tails containing 50 data points produce TPRs below 1 (compared to a random 50%). With a higher real TPR of 1.20, the directional error rate is still about 26%. The results are quite similar regardless of the underlying combination of mean and variance differences.

Minnesota provided scores from six other grades of similar size, but the authors selectively reported TPRs only from grade 11. So given seven grades in which a TPR less than 1 could be singled out, it is highly likely that at least one would appear even if random sampling error were the only cause. Hyde et al. did not justify their selective publication of TPRs from only one of seven grades in Minnesota. Further, the authors did not examine how mean and variance differences interacted to produce the TPRs. A higher proportion of females could be expected in the right tail even if male variance were larger, given a superior female mean in the subsample. This important conceptual problem was elided by the authors and many of the researchers above who cited them: a higher proportion of females above a certain cut-point does not necessarily emerge from greater female variability (in fact, it rarely does). So TPRs lower than 1 in isolation are not evidence against GMV. More succinctly, TPR < 1 does not imply VR < 1. To address the question directly rather than obliquely through TPRs, was there a race × sex × variance interaction in these assessments? Minnesota as well as two other states supplied data disaggregated by race, and males were 5-25% more variable in all racial groups in all three states. So the study does not provide convincing, generalizable evidence for racial differences in VRs or TPRs. The main results are strong support for GMV in math scores in the US: broken down by state and grade, male scores were more variable in 65 of 66 groups and VRs ranged from 0.94 to an exceptionally high 2.39.

Hyde and Mertz (2009) were not the only authors to overlook the distinction between VR < 1 and TPR < 1. It is worth observing how often this occurs. In their textbook on psychology and gender, Bosson et al. (2018) stated that GMV “does not hold consistently for people in every racial and ethnic group. For example, Hyde et al. (2008) found greater male than female variability in math performance for White students, but not for Asian students” (p. 237). Although Hyde et al. (2008) demonstrated TPR < 1, Bosson et al. inferred VR < 1. And in a review of academic gender differences, Priess and Hyde (2010) wrote: “Also important, however, is that the variance ratio appears to vary by ethnicity. For instance, in analyses of selective high school students from one U.S. state, the authors noted that VR = 2.06 for White, but only 0.91 for Asian American, 11th graders who scored in the top one percent on their state assessment” (p. 304). But VRs did not vary by ethnicity: when Priess and Hyde cited VRs of 2.06 and 0.91, they were referring to TPRs. The conflation of VR and TPR was so complete here that it led to a misstatement of plain facts. These instances do not exhaust the confusion around these concepts.
